## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: EchoSpaces
- **Category**: social

### Description
EchoSpaces is a decentralized discussion layer for communities.
Right now, most online spaces are filled with low-quality posts, bots, and throwaway accounts. EchoSpaces introduces a way for users to start or join focused conversations, while reputation and incentives encourage high-quality contributions.

### SL Integration  
Use Soundness Layer`s ZK reputation proofs to ensure that participants are real and have earned credibility.
Communities can set thresholds: e.g. only users with a certain reputation score can start threads.
SL handles cheap verifications so moderation doesn`t rely on centralized servers.

## Technical

### Architecture
User connects wallet → SL verifies reputation with ZK proof.
User joins or starts a conversation space.
Posts are stored on IPFS; metadata + reputation filters stored on SL-compatible chain.
Reputation grows as users` contributions get validated by peers.

### Stack
Frontend: React + Next.js
Backend: Node.js (lightweight API)
Blockchain: SL + Polygon (for cheap tx)
Storage: IPFS + WALRUS

### Features
Reputation-gated discussion spaces
Portable reputation across communities
Incentivized moderation (good moderators earn rep)

## Timeline

### PoC (2-3 weeks)
Basic discussion thread creation
SL verification demo
Simple UI for testing

### MVP (6-8 weeks)  
Full rep-gated community system
Incentive + reward logic
Integration with one real community as pilot

## Innovation
No more throwaway spam accounts → every voice carries weight.
Communities can self-regulate without central moderators.
Reputation becomes an asset users can carry across dApps.
